# This Admin API call is implemented as a custom script, instead of dumb
# passthrough to qubesd because it may get huge amount of data (whole root.img
# for example). qubesd cannot handle it because:
#  1. It loads the whole payload into memory, before even start looking at it
#     (and later, do not allow to modify/append it).
#  2. There is 64kB limit on payload size that qubesd can handle (because of
#     point 1).
#  3. Performance reasons (qubesd is not optimized for performance, passing
#     such large data stream through it would take ages).
#
# The whole admin.vm.volume.Import consists of:
#    1. Permissions checks, getting a path from appropriate storage pool (done
#       by qubesd)
#    2. Actual data import (done by this script, using dd)
#    3. Report final result, produce final response to the caller (done by
#       qubesd)
#    
#    This way we do not pass all the data through qubesd, but still can
#    control the process from there in a meaningful way. Note that the last
#    part (second call to qubesd) may perform all kind of verification (like
#    a signature check on the data, or so) and can also prevent VM from
#    starting (hooking also domain-pre-start event) from not verified image.
